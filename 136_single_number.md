# Question
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

*Note*
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?


# Answer
Key to the sulotion:
Using the feature of operater 'xor'.
A xor B xor A is B.
This could reach linear runtime.
